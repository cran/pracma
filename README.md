# Package PRACMA

## Introduction

This package provides R implementations of more advanced functions in
numerical analysis, with a special view on on optimization and time
series routines. Uses Matlab/Octave function names where appropriate
to simplify porting.

Some of these implementations are the result of courses on Scientific
Computing (``Wissenschaftliches Rechnen'') and are mostly intended to
demonstrate how to implement certain algorithms in R/S. Others are
implementations of algorithms found in textbooks.

## Details

The package encompasses functions from all areas of numerical analysis,
for example:

* Root finding and minimization of univariate functions,  
  e.g. Newton-Raphson, Brent-Dekker, Fibonacci or `golden ratio' search.
* Handling polynomials, including roots and polynomial fitting,  
  e.g. Laguerre's and Muller's methods.
* Interpolation and function approximation,  
  barycentric Lagrange interpolation, Pade and rational interpolation,
  Chebyshev or trigonometric approximation.
* Some special functions,  
  e.g. Fresnel integrals, Riemann's Zeta or the complex Gamma function,
  and Lambert's W computed iteratively through Newton's method.
* Special matrices, e.g. Hankel, Rosser, Wilkinson
* Numerical differentiation and integration,  
  Richardson approach and ``complex step'' derivatives, adaptive
  Simpson and Lobatto integration and adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature.
* Solvers for ordinary differential equations and systems,  
  Euler-Heun, classical Runge-Kutta, ode23, or predictor-corrector method 
  such as the Adams-Bashford-Moulton.
* Some functions from number theory,  
  such as primes and prime factorization, extended Euclidean algorithm.
* Sorting routines, e.g. recursive quickstep.
* Several functions for string manipulation and regular search,
  all wrapped and named similar to their Matlab analogues.

## Goals

It serves three main goals:

* Collecting R scripts that can be demonstrated in courses on
  Numerical Analysis or Scientific Computing using R/S as the chosen
  programming language.
* Wrapping functions with appropriate Matlab names to simplify
  porting programs from Matlab or Octave to R.
* Providing an environment in which R can be used as a full-blown
  numerical computing system.

Besides that, many of these functions could be called in R applications
as they do not have comparable counterparts in other R packages (at least
at this moment, as far as I know). 

All referenced books have been utilized in one way or another.
Web links have been provided where reasonable.

The following Matlab function names have been capitalized in `pracma' to
avoid shadowing functions from R base or one of its recommended packages
(on request of Bill Venables and because of Brian Ripley's CRAN policies):

    Diag, factos, finds, Fix, Imag, Lcm, Mode, Norm, nullspace (<- null),
    Poly, Rank, Real, Reshape, strRep, strTrim, Toeplitz, Trace, uniq (<- unique).

To use `ans` instead of `ans()` -- as is common practice in Matlab -- 
type (and similar for other Matlab commands):

    makeActiveBinding("ans", function() .Last.value, .GlobalEnv)
    makeActiveBinding("who", who(), .GlobalEnv)

### Note

The R package `matlab' contains some of the basic routines from Matlab,
but unfortunately not any of the higher math routines.
